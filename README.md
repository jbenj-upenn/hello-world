# hello-world
In addition to learning about git and github in my coding bootcamp, I'm using this tutorial just to become more familiar with things. 
I've been working in higher education for the last eleven years at two of the leading universities in the United States, let alone in Philadelphia. However, I'm looking to expand my marketability with new, relevant knowledge and skills.
